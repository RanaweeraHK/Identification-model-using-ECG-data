# Robust Person Identification model uisng Single Chnanel ECG data

In this project, we developed identification models using real-time ECG data. ECG signals can often be affected by noise from devices and changes from external factors, but our approach creates reliable models without needing any preprocessing or noise removal. This makes it faster and more practical for real-time applications.
